mimir
=====

Mimir is a new way to learn online.

Set-up
======

Mimir uses Django, a nifty Python based web development framework.
So to begin setting up Mimir first install Python.
Now we install Django, first grab the Django source
`wget https://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.5.1/tarball/`
`tar xzvf index.html`
Now install
`cd Django-1.5.1/`
`sudo python setup.py install`

Now you can clone this repo and test it out with
`python manage.py runserver`
