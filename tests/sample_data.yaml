        tutorial: "Introduction\n------------\n The determinant is a value associated with a square matrix. It can be computed from the entries of the matrix by a specific arithmetic expression, but there are also other ways to work it out. The determinant provides important information about a matrix of coefficients of a system of linear equations, or about a matrix that corresponds to a linear transformation of a vector space. In the first case the system has a unique solution exactly when the determinant is nonzero; when the determinant is zero there are either no solutions or many solutions. In the second case the transformation has an inverse operation exactly when the determinant is nonzero. A geometric interpretation can be given to the value of the determinant of a square matrix with real entries: the absolute value of the determinant gives the scale factor by which area or volume (or a higher dimensional analogue) is multiplied under the associated linear transformation, while its sign indicates whether the transformation preserves orientation. Thus a $2\\times 2$ matrix with determinant -2, when applied to a region of the plane with finite area, will transform that region into one with twice the area, while reversing its orientation.\n\nApplications\n------------\nDeterminants occur throughout mathematics. The use of determinants in calculus includes the Jacobian determinant in the substitution rule for integrals of functions of several variables. They are used to define the characteristic polynomial of a matrix that is an essential tool in eigenvalue problems in linear algebra. In some cases they are used just as a compact notation for expressions that would otherwise be unwieldy to write down.\nThe determinant of a matrix A is denoted det$(A)$, det $A$, or $|A|$. In the case where the matrix entries are written out in full, the determinant is denoted by surrounding the matrix entries by vertical bars instead of the brackets or parentheses of the matrix. For instance, the determinant of the matrix",

        tutorial: "Calculating the determinant of a $3\\times 3$ matrix (or larger) can be very unweildy to do by hand, fortunately there are a number of tricks that can help us do so. Row expansion is a itterative method that involves breaking down a big determinant into smaller ones. The first thing you do is pick a row or column with the most zero's or one's in to make your life easlier. Lets assume you have picked the $i^{th}$ row, then determinant of a $n \\times n$ matrix $A$, det($A$), with the $i^{th}$ $j^{th}$ entry of $A$ being $\\alpha_{i,j}$, would be $\\sum_{j=1}^{n} (-1)^{i+j} \\alpha_{i,j} det(m_{i,j})$ = $(-1)^{i+1} \\alpha_{i,1} det(m_{i,1}) + (-1)^{i+2} \\alpha_{i,2} det(m_{i,2}) + \\ldots + (-1)^{i+n} \\alpha_{i,n} det(m_{i,n})$. This looks like a scary formula but it is actually quite nice when you apply it as you break a $3 \\times 3$ determinant into claculating $3$ $2 \\times 2$ determinants and a $4 \\times 4$ determinant into calculating $12$ $2 \\times 2$ determinants by then applying the formula again to the $3 \\times 3$ minors you get.\n For justification of this formula look at the original formula for the determinant and you will see by reducing it down to the $1 \\times 1$ case you get the same formula.",

So we have a formula $\\int ax^b = \\frac{a}{b+1}x^{b+1} + c$. Then next thing I will show you is how to do a integration between limits, like on the graph the area between two numbers. So the integral of some function $f(x)$ between $a$ and $b$ is denoted $\\int_a^b f(x)$, if we let $F(x) = \\int f(x)$ the formula for $\\int_a^b f(x) = F(b) - F(a)$ so as a example for our polynomials we have $\\int_a^b cx^d = \\frac{c}{d+1}a^{d+1} - \\frac{c}{d+1}b^{d+1}$.",
