TODO List
=========
There are a lot of things marked in the source with a TODO comment, these vary in difficulty, but some of them are probably doable.

This list is in a rough soonness order:
- Add a what next section at the end of every lesson showing things that follow on from the lesson.
- Improve the what next section by ordering and not displaying lessons already taken by a user.
- Make basic skill tree
- Write tests!! Lots of them.
- Add possibility for references in lessons.
- Make homepage with stats on
- Make questions answerable
- Make random input for questions work
- Move some settings over to a separate file (secret key, db settings, templates location) and make default file
- Docstrings!!!!! Documentation everywhere
- Write blog posts
- Work out how to cache queries/see if it is automatic (it is automatic, so instead go though at some point and make sure we are making use of caching)
- Sexify everything

Done
====
